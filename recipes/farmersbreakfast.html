    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <h3>Roasted potatoes</h3>
        <li>Nonstick cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 small russet potatoes (300g), peeled and cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons oregano</li><br>

        <li>5 eggs</li>
        <li>2 kielbasa, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>3 pieces thick bacon, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>2 shallots, cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>Parsley, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425&deg;F (220&deg;C). Spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, toss together the potatoes, olive oil, salt, pepper, and oregano until coated. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20 minutes. Toss and cook for another 10 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs together.</li>
        <li>In a 10-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, cook the kielbasa until lightly browned. Transfer the kielbasa to a plate.
            Add the bacon slices to the pan until cooked through. Transfer the bacon to the same plate as the kielbasa, leaving the bacon grease in the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the shallots to the bacon grease and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add the roasted potatoes, kielbasa, and bacon to the pan and toss together until well-mixed.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg mixture evenly around the pan, coating the potatoes, kielbasa, and bacon. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover the pan. Cook until the eggs are just about set, 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Uncover the pan and place under a broiler. Broil until the eggs are fully set. Remove the pan from the broiler and let rest for 2 minutes before cutting into wedges to serve.</li>
    </ol>
