        <li>1 tablespoon hot water</li>
        <li>2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cups (390g)  all-purpose flour</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup (45g) whole wheat flour</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 cup (250g) unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup (130g) beet sugar</li>
        <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> cup (105g) firmly packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>8 ounces (250g) dark chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the espresso powder and hot water.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, salt, and baking powder.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the butter, beet sugar, and brown sugar, mixing until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, vanilla, and espresso powder mixture.</li>
        <li>Slowly mix in the flour mixture until the dough just comes together, then fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Line two baking sheets with parchment paper, then divide the dough into balls of approximately 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tablespoons (50g) and place on a prepared baking sheet. Using the palm of your hand, gently press each ball down on the parchment paper to make a thick disk. Refrigerate the baking sheets for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350&deg;F (180&deg;C). Line a room-temperature baking sheet with parchment paper, then place the chilled cookies on the baking sheet 2 inches (5cm) apart.</li>
        <li>Bake the cookies until they have slightly spread and the edges are golden brown, or about 15 to 20 minutes. Let them completely cool before consuming.</li>
